**Subject: Urgent Action Required: Review of Unsanctioned Decorative Gourd Placements (Policy 7.4b)**

**To:** Esteemed Residents of the Whispering Pines Homeowners Association
**From:** Herbert G. Fincher, Chairperson, Committee for Aesthetic & Horticultural Harmony (CAHH)
**Date:** 2025/08/12

Dear Esteemed Residents,

This email serves as an official notice and a gentle but firm reminder regarding community-wide adherence to the Whispering Pines Covenants, Conditions & Restrictions (CC&Rs), specifically concerning seasonal decorative placements as outlined in Bylaw 7, subsection 4b: "Flora and Faux-Flora: Permitted Display Parameters."

It has come to the attention of the Committee for Aesthetic & Horticultural Harmony (CAHH) that an unseasonable and frankly alarming proliferation of decorative gourds has been observed on several properties. While the Committee applauds proactive seasonal spirit, we must emphasize that we are currently in the Q3 Summer period (ending September 30th). As per the official HOA Seasonal Roadmap, gourd-based decor, including but not limited to pumpkins, ornamental squash, and related paraphernalia, is strictly embargoed until the Q4 Autumnal Kick-off date of October 1st.

The current premature gourd deployment is in direct violation of the agreed-upon aesthetic timeline and risks creating a significant "seasonal dissonance" that could negatively impact our neighborhood's carefully curated visual synergy. Furthermore, it sets a dangerous precedent for the early introduction of other seasonal items, and the committee simply does not have the bandwidth to address a potential rogue outbreak of premature cornucopias or unsanctioned festive wreaths before Thanksgiving.

**Therefore, we require immediate corrective action.**

All residents currently displaying non-compliant gourds are instructed to return them to a state of non-visibility (i.e., garage, shed, or approved storage container) no later than **5:00 PM this Friday, August 15th, 2025.**

Failure to comply will initiate the Standardized Non-Compliance Protocol, beginning with a formal written warning (The Lilac Letter), followed by potential fines as detailed in the CC&R appendix.

We trust that this is simply an oversight born from an excess of enthusiasm, and we look forward to seeing a beautiful and, more importantly, a *temporally appropriate* display of gourds from all residents in October. Let's work together to keep Whispering Pines the harmonious, well-regulated paradise we all chose to call home.

Synergistically yours,
